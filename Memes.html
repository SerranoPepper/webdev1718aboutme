<h1>Memes </h1>
<p> I love memes soo much I think no matter what problems or just goofy saterical crap that goes in in the world I'm 100% sure memes will be made to help humainity cope with any problems! According to the Merriam Webster dictionary a meme is "an amusing or interesting item (such as a captioned picture or video) or genre of items that is spread widely online especially through social media" Memes absolutely connect to the real world, as I said earlier there is a meme for everything, memes are such a popular idea that there's a few for anything that pops into your mind! Memes can relate to school, work, emotions, anxiety, relationships, friends and can be about how mondays suck and how some celebrities are insane sociopaths. </p>

<p> I've liked star wars for as long as I can remember I don't remember an exact time I started to get into it but I did and I'm still not over it. Basically the franchise began in 1977 with the film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope in 1981 which became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon. It was followed by the successful sequels  Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back 1980 which is my favorite movie of all time and Return of the Jedi 1983 these three films are the original Star Wars trilogy and after those successful films and the marketing the Star Wars universe continues to grow with numerous animated shows, games, comics and expanding the film franchise to 8 current movies and at least 3 more coming in the next few years. 
Star wars is a space fantasy so it doesn't have many "real world" connections but
